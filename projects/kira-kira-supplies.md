Kira Kira Supplies is a shopping website I developed as part of a class project in Fall 2019. The assignment gave me creative freedom to design a functional website and implement a responsive interface for users. The goal was to demonstrate an understanding of both HTML and CSS while simulating an online shopping experience. The name "Kira Kira" was inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeia meaning glittering or shining. I wanted users to feel that through buying and using Kira Kira Supplies, their lifestyle would become more vibrant and radiant. This project led me to consider how the design and theme of a website correlates with the products being sold to users.

I was responsible for the entire website development, including both the programming and design. The project was built using HTML and CSS, which were the first programming languages I learned. As a beginner, I faced many challenges, particularly with the design and layout of the website. To overcome these struggles, I frequently sought advice from peers and instructors. Through their input, I was able to enhance the aesthetics and navigation to ensure an engaging browsing experience.

While I have since learned and worked with more advanced programming languages, developing this project deepened my passion for web development. I recognized the importance of not only creating a functional website but also ensuring its visual appeal to attract users. This experience excited me about creating more projects, as I enjoyed both the technical and creative aspects of web development. It also inspired me to explore additional languages and take on more complex projects, further expanding my interest in the field.
