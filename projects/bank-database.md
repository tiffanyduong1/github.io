This bank database project was created as part of my ICS 212 course at UH Manoa. The project helped me develop a deeper understanding of C programming by requiring me to build both the user interface and the database system. Users could perform various actions such as adding, deleting, finding, or printing customer records. On the database side, I implemented functions to handle these operations, ensuring that the records were correctly sorted numerically by bank account number. This project focused on creating a functional and efficient system for managing customer data.

I was responsible for the entire project development, from setting up the database functions to designing the user interface. However, the instructor provided specific guidelines for C syntax, including the use of structures, parameters, and pointers. Unlike other projects that allow for more creative freedom, this one focused on mastering C programming by adhering to strict coding standards. My primary challenge was ensuring that the memory management worked seamlessly to avoid errors when handling customer records.

This project significantly enhanced my knowledge of C, as it requireed weekly additions over the course of a month to complete. Each week, new functionality was introduced, pushing me to adapt and improve my code incrementally. Meeting deadlines and ensuring that my code worked as expected was critical, as even minor errors could lead to significant issues. This experience sharpened my focus, taught me the importance of careful debugging, and improved my ability to manage complex programming tasks under a time constraint.
